Hi There!

Thanks for downloading this code!

I have some notes for you:

1. You have to create your database using PhpMyAdmin
2. Database name is "php_react_crud"
3. Import the SQL file called "db.sql" located in the "dev" folder.
4. You can ask me any questions related to this source code.
